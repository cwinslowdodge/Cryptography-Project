					<h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
					<p>The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. 
					It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is 
					replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet.<Br>

					In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, ends up in a form that can not be understood 
					at a simple glance.
					<h2>RSA</h2>
					<p>RSA was first described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman of the Massachusetts 
					Institute of Technology. Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, uses two 
					different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private. The public key can be shared 
					with everyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret. In RSA cryptography, both the public 
					and the private keys can encrypt a message; the opposite key from the one used to encrypt a message 
					is used to decrypt it. This attribute is one reason why RSA has become the most widely used 
					asymmetric algorithm: It provides a method of assuring the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity 
					and non-reputability of electronic communications and data storage.

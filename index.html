					The most common way for a password to be "hacked" is by the password's owner revealing the
					password to another individual. In the absence of this happening, passwords can be quite secure.
					As long as the website you're logging into has a secure connection, properly stores
					passwords in their databases, and prevents hackers from accessing their password databases,
					it is unlikely your password will be hacked or stolen.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the real world, however, there are problems with companies being hacked, and the tables
					in which encrypted passwords are stored being exposed. When this happens, hackers can try
					to find a user's password by encrypting a password guess and seeing if it matches the
					encrypted value in the table. This is often done in a brute force method, with every
					possible password, from least complicated to most, being attempted until the correct one is
					found. With modern computers and because this process is highly parallelizable (many
					computers can try to crack the same password at once), it is important to have a long and
					complicated password. This way, hackers will not be able to guess your password, even if
					they know the encrypted value.

					The formula we used for estimating how long it would take to break a password is very
					straightforward. If you are familiar with JavaScript, you can view the source of this
					webpage and see it for yourself.
				</p>
				<p>
					The time it takes to break a password is a function of the length and complexity of the
					password, and the number of encryption or hashes per second the hacker's computer can
					attempt. The length and complexity is defined by the number of possible combinations of
					characters. This is the number of characters in the character set raised to the power of
					the number of characters in the password. This number, the number of possible password
					combinations, is divided by the number of hashes that can be done per second, which we
					estimated to be 10 billion, and again divided by 2, because on the correct one will be found
					in the middle of the set of possible combinations. In order to obtain the character set for
					the password, we considered 4 separate character sets.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lowercase Letters [a-z] : 26 characters</li>
					<li>Uppercase Letters [A-Z] : 26 characters</li>
					<li>Numbers [0-9] : 10 characters</li>
					<li>Special Characters [^a-zA-Z0-9] : 31 characters (remaining printable ASCII characters)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The character set of the password was calculated to be the sum of cardinalities of the
					characters sets sharing any characters with the password.

					The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest
					forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message
					(called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters
					up or down in the alphabet. In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, ends up
					in a form that can not be understood at a simple glance. Below are examples of Caesar
					ciphers of the letters in the message typed above. You'll notice that the first and last
					ciphers (shifts of 0 letters and 26 letters), are both copies of the original message, as
					there are 26 letters in the alphabet.

				<p>
					RSA was first described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman of the
					Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric
					cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private.
					The public key can be shared with everyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret.
					In RSA cryptography, both the public and the private keys can encrypt a message; the opposite
					key from the one used to encrypt a message is used to decrypt it. This attribute is one reason
					why RSA has become the most widely used asymmetric algorithm: It provides a method of assuring
					the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-reputability of electronic communications
					and data storage.

			<div id="diffie-hellman">
				<p>
					Diffie-Hellman key exchange, also called exponential key exchange, is a
					method of digital encryption that uses numbers raised to specific powers to produce decryption
					keys on the basis of components that are never directly transmitted, making the task of a
					would-be code breaker mathematically overwhelming."

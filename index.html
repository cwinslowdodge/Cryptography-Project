			Although encryption isn't something everyone thinks about when they are asked to set up a
			 password for their accounts it is key to the security of their information. With this tool
			 we have endeavored to teach the public a little about a few different types of encryption 
			 and how/why password security is so importent.<br>
			 <b>Here are a few tips to make you password more secure:</b>
			 <ol>
			 	<li>Make sure you use different passwords for each of your accounts. 
			 	This can be difficult but use a password manager to help keep yourself secure.</li>
			 	<li>Be sure no one watches when you enter your password.</li>
			 	<li>Always log off if you leave your device, it only takes a moment for 
			 	someone to steal or change the password.</li>
			 	<li>Avoid entering passwords on computers you don't control, they may have 
			 	malware that could steal your passwords.</li>
			 	<li>Avoid entering passwords when using unsecured Wi-Fi connections 
			 	(like at the airport, school or coffee shop), hackers can intercept your passwords using free software like Wireshark.</li>
			 	<li>Don't tell anyone your password. Your trusted friend now might not 
			 	be your friend in the future. Keep your passwords safe by keeping them to yourself.</li>
			 	<li>Depending on the sensitivity of the information being protected, 
			 	you should change your passwords periodically, and avoid reusing a password for at least one year.</li>
			 	<li>Do use at least eight characters of lowercase and uppercase letters, 
			 	numbers, and symbols in your password. Remember, the more the merrier.</li>
			 	<li>Strong passwords are easy to remember but hard to guess. Iam:)2b29!, 
			 	This has 10 characters and says "I am happy to be 29!" I wish.</li>
			 	<li>Have fun with known short codes or sentences or phrases. 
			 	2B-or-Not_2b?, This one says "To be or not to be?"</li>
			 	<li>It's okay to write down your passwords, just keep them away from 
			 	your computer and mixed in with other numbers and letters so it's not apparent that it's a password.</li>
			 	<li>You can also write a "tip sheet" which will give you a clue to remember 
			 	your password, but doesn't actually contain your password on it. For example, 
			 	in the example above, your "tip sheet" might read "To be, or not to be?"</li>
			 </ol>

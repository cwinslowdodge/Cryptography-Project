			<h3>Encoding</h3>
			<p>
				Encoding is a process of turning data, often textual, into another representation.
				An example is converting letters in a word into binary in order to transmit them electronically.
				Often, however, the code that information is converted to is meant to be intentionally difficult
				to understand. This is done in two different ways, encryption and hashing.
			</p>
			<h3>Encryption</h3>
			<p>
				Encryption is the process of encoding information so that it cannot be easily read.
				This is a two-way process. Information can be encoded into a difficult to read <em>ciphertext</em>,
				and this ciphertext can be decrypted to produce the original information, known as the <em>plaintext</em>.
				Encryption allows for the encoded information to be read only by people or computers that
				have the key used to decrypt the information.
			</p>
			<h3>Hashing</h3>
			<p>
				Hashing is a process that encodes information in an intentionally one-way manner.
				Once the information is encoded, the code produced cannot be decrypted to produce
				the original information.

					Although these aren't things everyone thinks about when they are asked to set up a
					password for their accounts, they are key to the security of everyone's information. With this site
					we have endeavored to teach the public a little about a few different types of encoding
					and how/why password security is so important.

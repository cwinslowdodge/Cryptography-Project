					<h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
					<p>The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption. 
					It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is 
					replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet.<Br>

					In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, ends up in a form that can not be understood 
					at a simple glance.<Br>

					For example, here's the Caesar Cipher encryption of a message, using a right shift of 3.<Br>

					Plaintext:  
					THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
					Ciphertext: 
					QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD<Br>

					As unreadable as the resulting ciphertext may appear, the Caesar Cipher is one of the weakest 
					forms of encryption one can employ.<Br>

					The key space is very small. Using a brute force method, one could easily try all (25) possible 
					combinations in order to decrypt the message without initially knowing the key.
					The structure of the original plaintext remains intact. This makes the encryption method vulnerable 
					to frequency analysis - by looking at how often certain characters or sequences of characters appear, 
					one can discover patterns and potentially discover the key without having to perform a full 
					brute force search.

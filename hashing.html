        <h3>Hashing</h3>
        <p>
            While encryption is used to ensure that information is made secret in order to be read by parties who have
            the key, hashing is used to ensure that information is made secret and never read by anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            A cryptographic hash function is the official term for a hashing method used to securely encode information
            that no one should ever read or know. Cryptographic hash functions have several properties that allow them
            to be useful in internet security.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is computationally infeasible to determine an input based on the output.</li>
            <li>Any one specific input will always produce the same output.</li>
            <li>It is computationally infeasible to find two inputs that produce the same output.</li>
            <li>Minor changes to the input result in entirely different outputs.</li>
            <li>It is relatively fast to compute a cryptographic hash function.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Because of these properties, hashing is used for verifying people's passwords. When an account is created
            on a website, the account's password is hashed and stored in a database. When an attempt to login to that
            account is made. The password submitted with the login attempt is hashed and compared to the output originally
            stored in the website's database. If these two values match, the password is correct.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using a cryptographic hash function, the website never needs to store a user's password, and the password
            is kept secret.
        </p>
        <h3>Salt</h3>
        <p>
            Salt is a random of string of data stored with a password hash's output in a database. When a
            user makes the password, a salt is generated and added to the password before it is hashed. When additional
            login attempts are made, the salt is always added to the password before hashing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because website security is never perfect, salt is an extra precaution used when hashing passwords to keep them
            more secure. If a hacker is able to get access to the database of hashed password, the salt helps slow
            down the hacker from quickly breaking passwords. If multiple users share the same password, a hacker would
            be able to discover all the users by breaking just one of the passwords. However, with the passwords being salted,
            even if users have the same password, they each have a different salt, so the hacker is unable to tell that
            users share the same password.
        </p>
        <h3>How Passwords are Broken</h3>
        <p>
            The most common way for a password to be broken is by the password's owner revealing the
            password to another individual. In the absence of this happening, passwords can be quite secure.
            As long as the website you're logging into has a secure connection, properly stores
            passwords in their databases, and prevents hackers from accessing their password databases,
            it is unlikely your password will be broken.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the real world, however, there are problems with companies being hacked, and the tables
            in which hashing passwords are stored being exposed. When this happens, hackers try
            to find a user's password by hashing a password guess and seeing if it matches the
            password's hashed value in the table. This is often done in a brute force method, with every
            possible password, from least complicated to most, being attempted until the correct one is
            found. With modern computers and because this process is highly parallelizable (many
            processors can try to guess the same password at once), it is important to have a long and
            complicated password. This way, hackers will not be able to guess your password, even if
            they know the hashed output.

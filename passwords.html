				<label>Password Information</label>
				<p>
				The most common way for a password to be "hacked" is by the password's owner revealing the password to another individual. In the absence of this happening, passwords can be quite secure. As long as the website you're logging into has a secure connection, properly stores passwords in their databases, and prevents hackers from accessing their password databases, it is unlikely your password will be hacked or stolen.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the real world, however, there are problems with companies being hacked, and the tables in which encrypted passwords are stored being exposed. When this happens, hackers can try to find a user's password by encrypting a password guess and seeing if it matches the encrypted value in the table. This is often done in a brute force method, with every possible password, from least complicated to most, being attempted until the correct one is found. With modern computers and because this process is highly parallelizable (many computers can try to crack the same password at once), it is important to have a long and complicated password. This way, hackers will not be able to guess your password, even if they know the encrypted value.

				<label>Methodology</label>
				<p>
				The formula we used for estimating how long it would take to break a password is very straightforward. If you are familiar with JavaScript, you can view the source of this webpage and see it for yourself.
				</p>
				<p>
				The time it takes to break a password is a function of the length and complexity of the password, and the number of encryption or hashes per second the hacker's computer can attempt. The length and complexity is defined by the number of possible combinations of characters. This is the number of characters in the character set raised to the power of the number of characters in the password. This number, the number of possible password combinations, is divided by the number of hashes that can be done per second, which we estimated to be 10 billion, and again divided by 2, because on average, the correct one will be found in the middle of the set of possible combinations. In order to obtain the character set for the password, we considered 4 separate character sets:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lowercase Letters [a-z] : 26 characters</li>
					<li>Uppercase Letters [A-Z] : 26 characters</li>
					<li>Numbers [0-9] : 10 characters</li>
					<li>Special Characters [^a-zA-Z0-9] : 31 characters (remaining printable ASCII characters)</li>
					<li>The character set of the password was calculated to be the sum of cardinalities of the characters sets sharing any characters with the password.</li>
				</ul>

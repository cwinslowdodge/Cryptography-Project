				Encryption allows us to send information back and forth without it being read by somebody else.
				Many different algorithms exist to encrypt data, two of them being the Caesar Cipher and RSA
				Encryption. All encryption methods rely on some type of key used to encrypt and decrypt information.
				These keys come in two varieties explained below.
				You can read more about different encryption algorithms and how they use keys
				below by clicking on the different section buttons.
			</p>

			<br>

			<h3>Symmetric Key</h3>
			<p>
				In symmetric key encryption, one key is used to encrypt and decrypt information.
				The key must be shared between the party sending the message and the party receiving the message.
			</p>

			<h3>Asymmetric Key (Public/Private Key)</h3>
			<p>
				In asymmetric key encryption, one key is used to encrypt information, and another key is used to
				decrypt the encrypted information.
				The public key is used to encrypt information. The party sending the message uses this key. The private key
				is used to decrypt the information encrypted by the public key. The private key is known only to the party
				decrypting the message. For this to work in two directions, both parties have a public and private key pair.

							Caesar Cipher
						</div>
						<p>The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the simplest forms of encryption.
							It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext)
							is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the
							alphabet. In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, ends up in a form that
							can not be understood at a simple glance.
						</p>
						<p>
						Since the Caesar cipher doesn't encrypt messages much beyond just shifting the letters all by
							the same value, it is not very secure and thus shouldn't be used to encrypt anything
							meaningful. For a modern computer, it would only take a moment for it to figure out
							anything you've sent.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the Caesar cipher, the key is the number of letters in the alphabet that a letter is
							shifted. This is a symmetric key, since both the sender and the receiver must know and use
							the same number of letters. The receiver will shift in the opposite direction of the sender,
							however.
						</p>
						<p>
						Below you can enter a message and see it encrypted with the Caesar cipher.
							You'll notice that the first and last ciphers (shifts of 0 letters and 26 letters),
							are both copies of the original message, as there are 26 letters in the alphabet.

							RSA
						</div>
						<p>
						RSA was first described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman of the
							Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric
							cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private.
							The public key can be shared with everyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret.
							In RSA cryptography, both the public and the private keys can encrypt a message; the
							opposite key from the one used to encrypt a message is used to decrypt it. This attribute
							is one reason why RSA has become the most widely used asymmetric algorithm: It provides a
							method of assuring the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-reputability of
							electronic communications and data storage.
						</p>
						<p>
						Since RSA uses factors of very large primes, it is extremely difficult to find the private
							key (this is known as the discrete d-th root problem) and can take a very very long time
							with a lengthy message. This is another reason why RSA is used so widely today.
						</p>

							Diffie Hellman
						</div>
						<p>
						Diffie-Hellman key exchange, also called exponential key exchange, is a method of establishing a
							secret symmetric key between two parties, over an insecure channel such as the internet.
							Diffie-Hellman uses modular exponentiation and large prime numbers to produce keys on the
							basis of components that are never directly transmitted, making the task of a would-be
							code breaker mathematically overwhelming.
						</p>
						<p>
						The way Diffie-Hellman generates keys is slightly different from RSA, and because of this the
							only known way to get the secret components of the key is through the discrete logarithm
							problem. Because there is no known efficient way to compute this with computers, it would
							take a very long time to figure out a key generated via Diffie-Hellman and
							is part of the reason why Diffie-Hellman is widely used today for internet security.
